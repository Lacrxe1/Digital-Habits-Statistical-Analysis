# Digital Habits Statistical Analysis

I analyzed a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarekmasryo/digital-health-and-mental-wellness) to see what best predicts the number of times a person unlocks their phone everyday. I looked at 16 independent variables and narrowed it down to 6 which gave me a final R^2 score of 0.76. Finally, I created a Linear Regression Model to predict # of phone unlocks.
